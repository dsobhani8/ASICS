Task Title,Task Description
Explaining Model Training Hyperparameter Adjustment,"This task involves providing a clear and precise explanation for why a particular training hyperparameter—in this case, the learning rate—should be modified in response to changes in the model’s size or complexity. The pattern requires the system to identify a causal or principled relationship between the scale of a model and the recommended adjustment to its training regimen. Questions in this task solicit explanations grounded in machine learning theory or empirical practice that justify why a certain strategy is beneficial for training stability or performance."
Identifying Algorithm Best-Case Scenarios from Multiple-Choice Options,This task requires selecting the correct best-case scenario for a given sorting algorithm from a set of multiple-choice options. It involves understanding how the input structure or initial data ordering impacts the algorithm’s performance and then mapping this understanding to a specific choice among alternatives. The pattern emphasizes precise algorithmic behavior knowledge and the ability to discern which input condition optimizes runtime or efficiency.
Generating Content with a Desired Psychological or Emotional Effect,"This task entails producing statements, ideas, or information crafted to induce a specific psychological or emotional state—in the given example, sleepiness. The pattern focuses on creating content whose primary function is to elicit a non-factual, sensory, or mood-related reaction, rather than directly answering a technical or knowledge-based query. This requires empathetic or experiential understanding and the ability to translate that into appropriate language or suggestions."
