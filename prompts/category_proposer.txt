I will provide a series of data for you to remember. Subsequently, I will ask you some questions to test your performance! Here are questions for you to memorize.
{system inputs}
The above questions were answered by a system. Using these specific examples, are there any tasks that are shared among the questions the system answers?

For each identified task, please offer a detailed and precise description. Highlight the particular characteristics of the tasks in the questions the system answered.

Please focus on achieving a high level of specificity and clarity in your categorization, steering clear of broad or vague descriptions such as:
- ‘Subject-Specific Knowledge Requirement’
- ‘Task Ambiguity’
- ‘Context-Dependent Jargon Interpretation’
- ‘Specialized Domain Knowledge Required’
- ‘Complex Question Mishandling’
- ‘Ambiguously Phrased Question’
- ‘Implicit Contextual Understanding’
- ‘Implicit Language Competency Assumption’
- ‘Specific Language Processing Tasks’
- ‘Inference-Based Questions’

We will evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of the pattern descriptions using a separate set of unseen questions. Each description should be clear, precise, and comprehensive enough to allow us to reliably identify and categorize new questions that exhibit the same pattern characteristics, even if they differ in their specific content or phrasing.

For each task, please focus on isolating a single task among the questions, rather than grouping multiple tasks under a single task description.

Instead of discussing the content of the questions within each task description, please provide two short snippets of questions that demonstrate the identified task.

The desired format for presenting each task analysis is as follows:

1. **Task Title**: Provide a detailed description of the specific pattern observed in the questions that were answered by the system.
- Example Question 1 (Task 1)
- Example Question 2 (Task 1)

2. **Task Title**: Provide a detailed description of the specific pattern observed in the questions that were answered by the system.
- Example Question 1 (Task 2)
- Example Question 2 (Task 2)
