Before answering, provide your reasoning. Evaluate the alignment between the provided question
and the task based on the title and description. Importantly, a question should be considered
aligned even if the aspect connecting it to the criteria is not the primary focus of the question. The
question isn’t required to completely satisfy all the criteria. If any part of the question, no matter
how straightforward or simple, meets any aspect of the criteria, it should be considered aligned.
Additionally, assess if the task description is too vague, ambiguous, or broadly interpreted to make
a confident judgment on alignment and explicitly state the reasons for this uncertainty.
Category Title: {Category Title}
Description of Category: {Category Descrip}
Question: {question}
Analysis: Examine the task mode and its description along with the provided question. Identify
any elements in the question that relate to the task, regardless of their prominence. Reasoning:
Discuss the connections or discrepancies found during the analysis. Explain why these points lead
you to consider the question as aligned, unaligned, or too ambiguous to determine. Conclusion:
Provide your final assessment based on the analysis, reasoning, and task feedback. If the question
aligns with the task, state ’Conclusion: Aligned’. If the question does not align with the task, state
’Conclusion: Unaligned’. If it’s unclear whether the question aligns due to vagueness or ambiguity
in the task, state ’Conclusion: Uncertain’. If the task is deemed too vague or ambiguous, provide
specific reasons and suggest how it might be refined.
